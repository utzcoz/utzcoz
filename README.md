### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm utzcoz, a software engineer who focus on AOSP and its related areas.

I'm currently working on [Boringdroid](https://github.com/boringdroid), [BlissOS](https://www.blissos.org/) and [MaruOS](https://github.com/maruos/).

I also spend many time on [Robolectric](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric) as a community collaborator.

I'm open for remote jobs globally, and local jobs at Beijing, China.
